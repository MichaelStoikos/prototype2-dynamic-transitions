# Weyland-Yutani Terminal Experience

Welcome to the **Weyland-Yutani Terminal Experience**! This project recreates the terminal-style interface from the **Alien** franchise, allowing users to explore the history, characters, and lore of the series in a truly immersive retro-futuristic way. The experience is crafted with interactive animations, dynamic transitions, and a classic green-on-black terminal theme.

## Overview
