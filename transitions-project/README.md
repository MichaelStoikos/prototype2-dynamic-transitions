# Weyland-Yutani Terminal Experience

Welcome to the **Weyland-Yutani Terminal Experience**! This project recreates the terminal-style interface from the **Alien** franchise, allowing users to explore the history, characters, and lore of the series in a truly immersive retro-futuristic way. The experience is crafted with interactive animations, dynamic transitions, and a classic green-on-black terminal theme.

## Overview

This project is an interactive, terminal-themed website designed to evoke the retro-futuristic feel of the Weyland-Yutani terminals from the **Alien** film series. Users can explore the timeline of the Alien universe, delve into crew details, and witness the evolution of the Xenomorphs through cinematic animations.

## Features

- **Loading Screen**: Classic Weyland-Yutani loading animation with logo rotation and progress bar (built using GSAP).
- **Interactive Navigation**: Terminal-style home page with selectable options to explore the Alien universe.
- **Movie Timeline**: A side-scrolling timeline showcasing all Alien movies, including _Prometheus_, _Alien: Covenant_, and upcoming releases, complete with animations and scroll effects.
- **Crew Details**: Explore the personnel files of iconic characters from the Alien franchise, with typewriter text animations and clickable crew profiles.
- **Projector-Themed Movie Viewer**: Smooth, cinematic movie transitions using GSAP, simulating a retro projector changing slides for an immersive experience.
- **Custom Cursor**: A green crosshair cursor that fits the terminal aesthetic and enhances the retro experience.
- **3D-environment**: fully discoverable 3D-environment in First Person Perspective.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Vite) - Fast build system and modern JavaScript framework for the interface.
